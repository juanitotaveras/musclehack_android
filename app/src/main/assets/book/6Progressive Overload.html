    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Everything we've discussed so far counts for <span class="red">NOTHING</span>
        if you get this part wrong.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">There  is a point in a set where the body's &lsquo;Growth  Mechanism&rsquo;  is activated; stop before this point and virtually </span><span
            class="red" lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">NO</span><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE"> muscular growth is stimulated. You can liken this to a switch that&rsquo;s  flipped when you cross a threshold of pressure. This point is  sometimes called '</span>Overload<span
            lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">'.</span></p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">What then is <span class="red">PROGRESSIVE</span> overload?</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Progressive overload simply means that you can&rsquo;t keep
        lifting the same weights for the same number of reps from workout to workout. In short, you
        must continually...</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">...seek to increase the amount of weight and/or reps completed
        during any given set in each successive workout.<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So if you completed 9 reps of 50lbs to failure on your first
        set of <U><a href="http://www.musclehack.com/build-huge-biceps-with-this-unique-exercise/"
                     target="_top">Cable Preacher Curls</a></U>, next week you must aim to reach
        failure on the 10th rep or higher on the first set. </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When you can complete 12 reps at 50lbs, you increase the weight
        at your next workout. If you can&rsquo;t complete at least 8 reps, the weight is too heavy
        and you should adjust and go lighter (assuming you are training in the 8-12 rep range).</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Please don&rsquo;t be tempted to increase the weight by too
        much when you hit 12 reps. This is the downfall of many a bodybuilder, and the <span
                class="red">REAL</span> reason behind many plateaus. You should only increase the
        load <span class="red">MARGINALLY</span> to ensure ongoing gains. My rule of thumb is
        basically to increase the load by 5%-10%.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">(When you start THT you&rsquo;ll need to &lsquo;feel around&lsquo;
        for the correct weights for each exercise. Don&rsquo;t worry, just go to positive failure
        and make a note for your next workout.)</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Please note that the THT rep-ranges I am about to introduce are
        not pulled out of thin air, nor are they based on tradition. Reaching failure in this window
        ensures that the adaptations you force the body to make are <span class="red">ANAEROBIC,  MUSCLE-BUILDING</span>
        adaptations.</p>
