<p class="red" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" align="center" >How To Warm-Up For THT Workouts</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Your  <span class="red">THT</span> workouts  <span class="red">MUST</span> be  preceded by an adequate warm-up. Why  is it so important? You simply don&rsquo;t have access to  100%  of  your strength without a proper warm-up. <br />
</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">The  objectives of a warm up are to  raise  your body temperature, raise your pulse, mobilize the joints, prevent  injury, and acclimate to lifting heavy loads (both physically and  mentally).<br />
</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">There  are many ways to warm up. Getting the warm-up right depends on the  type of training you&rsquo;re undertaking. Just  as you must select the correct type of training to suit your goals,  you must also select the correct type of warm up to  <span class="red">MAXIMALLY</span> benefit  your bodybuilding workout.</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Typically,  there are 3 components of a warm up: <span class="red">(1) </span>Pulse  Raiser<span class="red"> (2)</span> Joint Mobility<span class="red"> (3) </span>Stretching.<br />
</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">However,  as  Muscle  Hackers  we  can scratch &lsquo;stretching&rsquo; off our list. Stretching a muscle can  cause it to temporarily weaken. This is technically referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Stretching-Induced  Force Deficit</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">While  athletes with different goals can and  <span class="red">SHOULD</span> stretch,  we shouldn&rsquo;t and don&rsquo;t need to. Here&rsquo;s  the point: we can mobilize joints, get our pulse and body temperature  up, and acclimate to heavy weights with just 1 method<span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">...doing  a lighter version of our first working set.</span><br />
</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So  here&rsquo;s how to warm-up optimally for a  <span class="red">THT</span> workout:</p>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="red">(OPTIONAL)</span> 2-3 minutes of light aerobic activity e.g. cross trainer. This is  	your &lsquo;pulse raiser&rsquo;.<br />
</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="red">WARM-UP  	SET 1</span>:  	10 reps at  	50%  	of  	your first working set weight. For example, if you are about to  	bicep curl 50kg on your first set, curl 25kg for 10 reps.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Rest  	for 1 minute.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="red">WARM-UP  	SET 2</span>:  	4-5  	reps at about 70-75%  	of  	your first working set</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Rest  	a minute.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="red">WARM-UP  	SET 3</span>:  	1 or 2 reps at  	90%  	of  	your first working set.</p>
</ul>
<ul>
  <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Rest  	a minute then perform your first  	working  set.<br />
</p>
</ul>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When  doing the  full-body  3-day  <span class="red">THT</span> workout,  the initial warm-up sets and working set of squats are sufficient to  get the whole body warmed-up. There's no need to repeat this process  before each body part. </p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Now,  when you&rsquo;re done warming up you possess a short-term quality that  you must use immediately â€“ you're at your  <span class="red">STRONGEST</span>! You're ready for an incredible workout!</p>
