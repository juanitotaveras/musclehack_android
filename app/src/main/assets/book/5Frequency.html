    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Because the size of a muscle is proportional to its strength,
        if you&rsquo;re stronger on your next workout, you&rsquo;ve overcompensated. Therefore, if
        you complete more reps on the same exercise during the next workout, you can be confident
        that you&rsquo;ve overcompensated. And you'll do that a lot on THT!</p>
