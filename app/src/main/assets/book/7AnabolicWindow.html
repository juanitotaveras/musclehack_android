<p class="red" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US" align="center" >THE ANABOLIC WINDOW (GOLDILOCKS PRINCIPLE)</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">During  your workouts there is a window of opportunity in every set in which  to stimulate the body to build muscle. You simply <span class="red">CANNOT</span> afford to mess this up.</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span class="red">THT</span> specializes in muscle growth. This being the case, we specifically  want our body to make the <span class="red">ANAEROBIC</span> adaptation of increasing the size of its muscle fibers, in  particular, the fast twitch fibers. </p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Obviously  then we must train in a way that <span class="red">MAXIMIZES</span> anaerobic adaptations. With me so far? Good.</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">When  training for size gains, a set should not be too short, nor too long.   So, what do I mean by &ldquo;The  Anabolic  Window&rdquo;?</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">What  I mean by this is that there is a certain duration that a set should  last that ensures you are actually stimulating muscle growth. You  will sometimes hear this referred to as &lsquo;Time Under Load&rsquo;.<br />
</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">Muscle  growth can be stimulated from sets lasting anywhere from as little as  20 seconds right up to about a minute long. Therefore, for each and  every set you&rsquo;ll pick a weight that causes you to reach a point of  muscular failure anywhere between 20 and 60 seconds.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><br />
This  is the &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; principle of building muscle. It's the &lsquo;<span class="red">THT  Anabolic Window</span>&rsquo;  and you should train within this duration-per-set for maximum muscle  growth. </p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">THT  will always target that sweet spot in the middle and optimize your  potential for growth!</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Lifting  60%-85% of your 1 Rep Max is the single best way to stimulate growth  according to this meta-analysis [9] (a study of studies). </p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This  translates reps-wise into a low of 6 reps per set, to a high of 12  reps per set. The <span class="red">EXACT</span> reps-per-set used in THT  training.</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Training  at a max of 12 reps per set is also recommended by the National  Strength and Conditioning Association [10]. </p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">In  addition, all intelligent people in this field know and recommend  this: Tom Venuto, Charles Poliqin, Mark Sisson, and many more. This  isn't my mere opinion. It's a fact!</p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Each  and every set of THT  training will have you training <span class="red">OPTIMALLY</span> within the <span class="red">ANABOLIC  WINDOW.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">To  conclude, keep your sets short and intense. You&rsquo;ll soon witness the  <span class="red">FASTEST</span> muscle growth you&rsquo;ve ever experienced!</p>
