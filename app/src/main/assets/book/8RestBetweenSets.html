    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">There is something that you <span class="red">SHOULD</span> be
        doing between sets to <span class="red">MAXIMIZE</span> your size and strength gains!
        Something so simple it&rsquo;s shocking! It <span class="red">ISN'T</span> stretching (bad
        idea), posing, flexing, or any form of cardio whatsoever. It is simply resting, chilling,
        breathing.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Furthermore, if you&rsquo;re training for maximizing strength
        and size, those periods of &ldquo;doing nothing&rdquo; should be lasting 2 or 3
        minutes.<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Check out this study [12] - Title: <strong>Strength increases
        in upper and lower body are larger with longer inter-set rest intervals in trained
        men</strong>. They said, &ldquo;The purpose of the current study was to compare different
        rest interval durations on upper and lower body strength.&rdquo;</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">They took 36 trained men and put them on a 16-week resistance
        training program. The men were split into groups resting for 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 5
        minutes between sets. They tested the maximal strength of all groups before the study,
        8-weeks through, and after the full 16 weeks. They concluded...</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">&ldquo;<span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">The  findings of the current study indicate that utilising </span><span
            lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">3  or 5 min</span><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE"> rest intervals between sets may result in significantly </span><span
            lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">greater  increases in upper and lower body strength</span><span
            lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE"> beyond the initial weeks of training versus utilising 1-min rest  intervals between sets.&rdquo;</span><br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">So if you&rsquo;re not completely new to bodybuilding, you&rsquo;re
        much better off resting longer between sets since increases in strength correlate positively
        with muscle size.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">I recommend 3 minutes rest between sets for larger compound
        movements, and 2 minutes for smaller body parts like biceps or calves. However, if you&rsquo;re
        completely wiped after a particular set, don&rsquo;t be afraid to take a little longer if
        you feel you really need it.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">This amount of time allows the recovery of intra-cellular
        energy stores in the muscle. It is also adequate for flushing out any lactate that has built
        up from previous sets. This enables us to keep up our level of intensity high throughout the
        entire workout.<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">If you don&rsquo;t allow enough rest between sets, you&rsquo;ll
        restrict the amount of overload you can place on the intended muscle in successive sets.
        Remember, this is bodybuilding, not an endurance contest. </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">If you need more proof, another study [13] entitled &quot;The
        effect of resistance exercise rest interval on hormonal response, strength, and hypertrophy
        with training&quot; found that arm cross-sectional area (thickness) increased more when
        trainees took 2.5 minutes rest as compared to a shorter 1-minute rest interval.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Therefore strategies like &ldquo;<a
            href="http://www.musclehack.com/why-supersets-arent-so-super/">super-setting</a>&rdquo;
        2 different body parts are just a terrible idea. You&rsquo;ve nothing to gain and everything
        to lose by super-setting. The goal of a bodybuilding workout is not to get it over with in
        the shortest amount of time possible. Neither is it to try and win some sort of respect from
        the &ldquo;bros&rdquo; in the gym by doing back to back sets and thinking it makes you look
        like a tough guy. </p>
    <p align="center" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">The  message is simple: </span><span
            class="red" lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE">Hit  it hard. Then rest.</span></p>
