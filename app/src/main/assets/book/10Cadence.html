        <span class="red">THE ULTIMATE MUSCLE-BUILDING CADENCE</span></p>
    <p>Quick Definition: &quot;<strong>Cadence</strong>&quot; in bodybuilding simply refers to the
        speed at which you lift and lower the weight.</p>
    <p>Many studies, including this one [11], have shown that for improving strength and size at an
        optimal rate, you should lift a weight quite quickly and lower it more slowly. Pushing a
        weight at almost maximal speed produces a better stimulus for changes in strength and
        size.</p>
    <p>I've long recommended to my readers a lifting speed of around 1 second, and a lowering of
        around 2 seconds. This was shown to be very much the case in the above study where
        participants using this cadence increased their strength 10 times as much as a control
        group, which used a self-selected speed. 10 times, guys â€“ that's huge!</p>
    <p>To be more exact, it took the experimental group 0.8 seconds to perform the upward,
        concentric movement, and the downward, eccentric part took 2 seconds to perform.<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><em><span lang="de-DE" xml:lang="de-DE"><strong>Why  is this cadence best?</strong></span></em>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> You can use slightly heavier weights with this kind of
        cadence, not to mention it also helps maximize muscle fiber recruitment.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> The researchers said,</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> &ldquo;This study shows that the speed execution of an
        exercise leads to a specific muscle recruitment during the whole period&rdquo;<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> This means that a faster lift and slower lowering sends a more
        <span class="red">POWERFUL</span> signal from the nervous system to recruit more muscle
        fibers. And the more fibers involved in a lift, the <span class="red">GREATER</span> the
        potential growth stimulation!</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><em><span lang="de-DE"
                                               xml:lang="de-DE"><strong>Momentum?</strong></span></em>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> Are you thinking that this kind of result could be caused by
        simply producing extra momentum? Not so.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> This is something that I&rsquo;ve been saying for years: if it
        is even <em>possible</em> for you to create momentum by pushing a weight at near maximal
        speed, then the weight itself is too light. That&rsquo;s your problem, not the speed of
        execution.</p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> If you select a weight that forces failure on or before the
        12th rep, you just can&rsquo;t generate momentum with a 1 second lifting speed. So get your
        weights right!<br/>
    </p>
    <p lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> So on <span class="red">THT</span> aim for around a 1 second
        lift, 2 seconds lowering cadence. Though don't be so strict that you're counting this in
        your head. Just &ldquo;feel&ldquo; for the proper cadence; it comes naturally and
        instinctively. <br/>
