    <p>When getting starting with THT training, you'll use the <span
            class="red">8-12 rep range</span> for almost every set. </p>
    <p>This means that for each and every set, the weight needs to be heavy enough to not allow you
        to get more than 12 reps, but it needs to be light enough so you can get at least 8.

        This will involve a little 'trial and error' on your first 1 or 2 THT workouts, but it's
        well worth the gains you are going to get. </p>
    <p>If you got 8 or 9 reps on the first set of a particular exercise, you will need to knock off
        about 10% of the weight for the 2nd set to allow you to and rep to positive failure again
        between 8 and 12 reps. <em>Remember we get a little weaker with each successive set, so we
            need to lighten the load a little to compensate for this fact.</em></p>
    <p>If you only got 8 reps on your first set at 50kg, knock 5kg off and use 45kg in your second
        set to make sure you can get 8 or more reps the second time around. If you got 12 reps in
        your first set, you can use the same weight in the second set because you'll almost
        certainly get at least 8 reps. </p>
    <p><strong>What is Positive Failure?</strong> Positive failure is defined as that point in a set
        when you can no longer complete a full positive/lifting part of the rep without assistance.
        This is when you end your set. </p>
