"I searched through tons of websites, blogs, and forums and then I found MuscleHack. The human body is the human body, male or female; we are just as capable of doing the same exercises as men and we should do the same exercises that they do."

"At 45 years old and 297 pounds, I decided it was time to transform. I downloaded your THT workout program to learn as much as I could. I decided to commit and get �serious� about doing this the right way! Thank you for your free programs and for keeping it real."
