    <h4>Meet the developer:</h4>
    <h3>"Juanito" Juan Taveras IV</h3>
    <p>I obtained a Radio-Television-Film degree and Computer Science degree from the University of
        Texas
        at Austin in 2018.</p>
    <p>I worked as an engineer for The Home Depot for a while, and now I'm an Android Software
        Engineer
        at Google.</p>
    </br>
    <p>I like to read books, play music, create videos, write code, and lift heavy things.</p>

    <p>I have consistently gained muscle using the THT program since 2012, and
        I know you'll have great results with it too!</p>

    <p>If you've enjoyed this app and want me to keep improving it, email me at
        musclehackdeveloper@gmail.com
        with your thoughts.</p>

    <p>I will update this page with links to my current products in the future. New projects coming
        soon!</p>
