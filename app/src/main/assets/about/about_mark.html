    Mark says, "I believe that THT training is the single best way to train for size and strength gains. It works, it’s been proven by thousands, and it’s totally free.<br>
    When I first started, I was a skinny-fat guy: About 22% body fat, skinny arms, no muscle and a fat gut. After years of research and training, I believe I have cracked the code on optimal training and nutrition strategies. I'm 100% confident that I can transform your body!<br>
    What I am passionate about is building as much lean muscle as possible while having and keeping a low-body fat percentage. It's all about that muscular but shredded look. And if can do it with my less-than-average bodybuilding genetics, anyone can!"

    Where to start? Begin by reading the free THT training manual, then go into the workout tracker and start training! Using the science-based principles of THT, Mark is confident that you'll see size gains in the mirror within weeks! Not months or years like other programs.
